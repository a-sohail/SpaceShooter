# SpaceShooter

A 2-player spaceshooter game where players will need to dodge/destroy asteroids while simulatenously fighting against each other.
Use the mouse-cursor to move around asteroids, left-ctrl to shoot and WASD to tilt/move around.

The game is hosted on a LAN server because I didn't want to pay for multiplayer hosting :) 

You can play by downloading the SpaceShooter folder and running the Game.exe in the Builds folder.
One person should host a game, initialize broadcasting and then start broadcasting.

The other player should listen to broadcasting. A list of games will appear, select the first one and let the host start game.
